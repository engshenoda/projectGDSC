          <h2>poverty and hunger.</h2>
          <p>
            Poverty and hunger are major global challenges that affect millions
            of people around the world. Poverty is characterized by the lack of
            access to basic needs and resources, including food, shelter,
            education, and healthcare. Hunger, on the other hand, is the result
            of inadequate access to food, which can lead to malnutrition and
            starvation.

              <h3>Lack of Education</h3>
              <p>
                Education is a crucial factor in reducing poverty and hunger.
                Without education, individuals lack the skills and knowledge
                needed to secure a stable income and improve their livelihood.

              <h3>Unemployment</h3>
              <p>
                The lack of job opportunities or the inability to secure
                employment due to limited skills or education contributes to
                poverty and hunger.

              <h3>Inadequate infrastructure</h3>
              <p>
                Poor infrastructure, such as a lack of roads, electricity, and
                clean water, hinders economic growth and development, leading to
                poverty and hunger.

              <h3>Limited access to resources</h3>
              <p>
                People living in poverty often have limited access to resources
                such as land, capital, and credit, which limits their ability to
                improve their lives and escape poverty.

                Climate change impacts agricultural productivity, leading to
                food insecurity and poverty, particularly in developing
                countries where agriculture is a significant source of income.

              <p>
                The unequal distribution of resources and wealth within a
                society can result in poverty and hunger for those who are left
                behind or marginalized.

          The causes of poverty and hunger are multifaceted and include
          economic, social, and environmental factors. These include lack of
          economic opportunities, conflicts and wars, climate change and
          environmental disasters, discrimination and inequality, corruption,
          lack of investment in infrastructure, and population growth.
          <br /><br />
          Addressing poverty and hunger requires a comprehensive approach that
          includes improving access to education, healthcare, and economic
          opportunities, increasing investment in infrastructure, promoting
          social justice and equality, and addressing the root causes of
          conflict and environmental degradation. It also requires international
          cooperation and collaboration to ensure that resources are distributed
          fairly and effectively.

          <p>
            Sustainable development is a concept that seeks to balance economic growth,
            social well-being, and environmental protection. It involves meeting the
            needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations
            to meet their own needs. There are many ways to approach sustainable development,
            but one common framework is the four-point approach, which includes:

            According to the World Bank, about 9.2% of the world, or 719 million people,
